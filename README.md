# PlayFair-Cypher-
Implementation of the playfair cypher I did for Systems Security course

It was a bit of a rushed assignment and as such there are several improvements that can be made, such as the obvious one of moving the class to its own file.

Usage: php main.php <key> <filename.extension> <encrypt/decrypt>
Requirements: filename.extension should be in the same directory as the script

The script encrypts/decrypts the contents of the file (text).
